# 490_Senior_Project

Lightweight README for developers â€” how to get the backend serving the static frontend and the basic API.

Prerequisites

- Python 3.11+ (use a virtual environment)
- Install dependencies:

```powershell
python -m venv .venv; .\.venv\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Run the server

From the repository root (recommended):

```powershell
python -m backend.app
```

Or from the backend folder:

```powershell
cd backend
python app.py
```

What you can open in a browser

- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`  -> redirects to `/homepage/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/homepage/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/dashboard/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/resources/`
- `http://127.0.0.1:5000/account/`

API (JSON)

- `GET /api` - status
- `GET /api/leaks?limit=n` - latest leaks (default 10)
- `GET /api/resources` - static resources
- `GET, POST /api/account` - mock account endpoint

Notes for developers

- Frontend files are static HTML/CSS under `homepage/`, `dashboardpage/`, `resourcespage/`, and `accountpage/`.
- The Flask app serves these with friendly URLs (no `.html`) and remaps asset requests so CSS/images load correctly. See `backend/app.py` if you need to change mappings.
- Database helpers and models are in `backend/database.py`. `init_db()` will create the SQLite DB and the `leaks` table.
- The `/api/account` endpoint is a mock; it does not persist users.

Troubleshooting

- If a page looks unstyled, make sure you opened the trailing-slash URL (e.g. `/dashboard/`).
- If imports fail, confirm you ran from the repo root and installed dependencies in the active virtualenv.

Extras (optional improvements)

- Add a `404.html` and serve it for missing routes.
- Replace server-side remapping by changing frontend asset links to absolute paths (requires editing the HTML).
